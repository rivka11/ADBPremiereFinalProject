# ADBPremiereFinalProject
I used this project to strengthen my databased security skills. The database is designed with users and roles and various permissions assigned to certain roles. The goal was to limit users' access to the database by assigning them permissions to parts required for users' tasks. Users are required to login to perform changes to the database, and the database authenticates users.
